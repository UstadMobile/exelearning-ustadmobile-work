Running eXe as a Web Server for remote users:

EXE can run as a desktop app with the UI displayed through the browser
or can run in WebApp mode to service multiple users over the network.

To use eXe as a web service:

1. Open up exe.conf (in ~/.exe normally or exe/config if running in 
   standalone mode

2. Change the line appMode = DESKTOP to appMode = WEBAPP and save it

3. Create a file called auth-settings.json in the config directory (
   same directory where exe.conf is) and put in authentication settings.
   Currently on the Experience API is supported - e.g.

{
    "auth_class_name" : "exe.webui.webservice.tincanbackend.TinCanUserBackend",
    "xapi_base" : "http://umcloud1.ustadmobile.com/umlrs",
    "user_dir_path" : "/home/ubuntu/exe-users/%(username)s",
    "autocreate_user_path" : "1"
}

4. Run eXe - it will by default run on port 51235

5. To run as an upstart job - make sure there is a user on system called
   exelearning (upstart should run job as this user and have this for 
   home dir)

sudo cp doc-dir/exelearning-upstart.example.conf /etc/init/exelearning.conf
sudo service exelearning start
