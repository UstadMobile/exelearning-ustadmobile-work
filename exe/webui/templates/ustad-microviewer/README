Micro 'Emulator'

The contents of this file can be used to see what content will look
like in a feature phone (eg Java 2 Micro Edition) without requiring
a browser plugin.  It uses MicroEMU skin device.xml files and images
on an HTML5 canvas to simulate a feature phone (using the UstadJS lib)

For a course exported using the UstadMobile EPUB export; unzip it and
copy the files in this directory to the EPUB directory.  Then open
deviceframe_micro.html to see the course as it would appear on a 
feature phone.
